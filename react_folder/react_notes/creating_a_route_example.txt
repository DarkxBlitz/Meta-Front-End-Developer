First, install the react-router package by executing the command npm install react-router-dom@6. Ensure you do this before proceeding with any other steps.

Step 1
Add a new file, Contact.js, to the root of the src folder. 

Step 2

Inside the Contact.js file, add an ES5 function, named Contact. Add the export default Contact after the Contact function's closing curly brace. 

Step 3
Inside the body of the Contact function, add a return statement with the following code: <h1>Contact Little Lemon on this page.</h1>. 

Step 4
Inside the App.js file, import the newly-built Contact component. 

Step 5
Inside the App.js file's App function's return statement, locate the nav element, and inside of it, add another <Link> element, with the to attribute pointing to "/contact", the className set to "nav-item", and the the text inside the Link element's opening and closing tags set to Contact.

Step 6
Inside the Routes element, add a third route, with the path attribute pointing to "/contact", and the element attribute set to {<Contact />}. 

Step 7
Save all your changes and view your updates in the served app. You should have three links in the top navbar, and the third link should be Contact. Once you click the link, the sentence "Contact Little Lemon on this page" should replace whatever other content was under the navbar previously.

Here is the Contact.js file:

function Contact() {
    return  <h1>Contact Little Lemon on this page.</h1>
}
export default Contact


Here is the completed App.js file:

import "./App.css";
import Homepage from "./Homepage";
import AboutLittleLemon from "./AboutLittleLemon";
import Contact from "./Contact";
import { Routes, Route, Link } from "react-router-dom";

function App() {
  return (
    <div> 
	  <nav>
      <Link to="/" className="nav-item">Homepage</Link>
      <Link to="/about" className="nav-item">About Little Lemon</Link>
      <Link to="/contact" className="nav-item">Contact</Link>
	  </nav>
      <Routes> 
        <Route path="/" element={<Homepage />}></Route>
        <Route path="/about" element={<AboutLittleLemon />}></Route>
        <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />}></Route>
      </Routes>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
