three specific methods that exist on arrays:

1)forEach 
2)filter
3)map

1)The forEach() method
Arrays in JavaScript come with a handy method that allows you to loop over each of their members. 
EXAMPLE:
const fruits = ['kiwi','mango','apple','pear'];
function appendIndex(fruit, index) {
    console.log(`${index}. ${fruit}`)
}
fruits.forEach(appendIndex);

output:
0. kiwi
1. mango
2. apple
3. pear

Very often, the function that the forEach() method needs to use is passed in directly into the method call, like this:

const veggies = ['onion', 'garlic', 'potato'];
veggies.forEach( function(veggie, index) {                     //This is where the function is passed for each element in the array
    console.log(`${index}. ${veggie}`);              
});


2)The filter() method
Another very useful method on the array is the filter() method. It filters your arrays based on a specific test. Those array items that pass the test are returned.
EXAMPLE:
const nums = [0,10,20,30,40,50];
nums.filter( function(num) {
    return num > 20;
})

output:
[30,40,50]

3)The map method
This method is used to map each array item over to another array's item, based on whatever work is performed inside the function that is passed-in to the map as a parameter. 
EXAMPLE:
[0,10,20,30,40,50].map( function(num) {
    return num / 10
})

output:
[0,1,2,3,4,5]
