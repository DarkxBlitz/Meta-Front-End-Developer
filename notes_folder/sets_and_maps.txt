Working with Maps in JavaScript
To make a new Map, you can use the Map constructor:

new Map();

Note: maps do not have inheritance
Example:

let bestBoxers = new Map();
bestBoxers.set(1, "The Champion");
bestBoxers.set(2, "The Runner-up");
bestBoxers.set(3, "The third place");

console.log(bestBoxers);

output:
Map(3)Â {1 => 'The Champion', 2 => 'The Runner-up', 3 => 'The third place'}

To get a specific value, you need to use the get() method. For example:  
bestBoxers.get(1); // 'The Champion'


Working with Sets in JavaScript
To build a new set, you can use the Set constructor:

new Set();

Example:
const repetitiveFruits = ['apple','pear','apple','pear','plum', 'apple'];
const uniqueFruits = new Set(repetitiveFruits);
console.log(uniqueFruits);

output:
{'apple', 'pear', 'plum'}
